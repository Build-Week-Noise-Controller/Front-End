The React front end of the application is deployed [here](https://noise-controller-23.netlify.com/)

## Motivation

As a teacher, it can be hard to control the noise level in your classroom! You need an app that holds kids attention, and is sensitive to the noise level in the room to motivate them to stay quiet. While some exist, they seem to encourage kids to yell (like balls that bounce higher if you yell louder). This app will reveal unique animals (choose a theme for this app) only if it's quiet enough, keeping the kids quiet.

## Implemented features

- Users can sign up and create a classroom.
- Classroom will receive points based on how many creatures appear on the screen if it's quiet enough
- Users can set the sensitivity of their microphone
- Shows a live score on the page and final score page at the end of each day.
- Users can comment and message one another in the app
- Scoreboard that diplays classroom daily scores
